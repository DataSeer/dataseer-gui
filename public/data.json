Of primary concern are issues around consent and identifiability. Ideally, consent for data sharing is obtained from participants before data collection occurs. If the study design does not involve consenting new participants, then ethics board approval needs to be sought with respect to sharing data without consent. Careful de-identification (removal of personally identifying data such as birthdates) and/or anonymization needs to happen prior to sharing or deposition in a repository. Consultation with your ethics review board is required to determine what level of de-identification or anonymization is needed in your specific case. However, here are some basic guidelines (from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://irb.ucsf.edu/definitions#18\" class=\"urlextern\" title=\"https://irb.ucsf.edu/definitions#18\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://irb.ucsf.edu/definitions#18</a>) for data from the USA, although these are likely applicable in other jurisdictions:</p><p>1. an experienced expert determines that the risk that certain information could be used to identify an individual is &#x201C;very small&#x201D; and documents and justifies the determination, or</p><p>2. the data do not include any of the 18 identifiers (of the individual or his/her relatives, household members, or employers) which could be used alone or in combination with other information to identify the subject.

Of primary concern are issues around consent and identifiability. Ideally, consent for data sharing is obtained from participants before data collection occurs.

Careful de-identification (removal of personally identifying data such as birthdates) and/or anonymization needs to happen prior to sharing or deposition in a repository.
